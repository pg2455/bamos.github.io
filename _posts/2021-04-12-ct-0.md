Technology has been instrumental in addressing the vast majority of our problems.
Since March 2020, policy experts have faced a challenging trade-off between public health and economic activity.
As a result, countries have gone through a series of lockdowns, experiencing a yo-yo economy.
Digital Contact Tracing should have been an obvious technical solution to such a globally prevalent problem, i.e., to control the disease outbreak while allowing regular daily activity.
Surprisingly, it wasn't adequate to address this demanding problem.
Perhaps, there was not enough user adoption.
The app user doesn't receive any immediate utility from the app, so maybe there wasn't good enough messaging or incentives to foster sufficient adoption.
These questions will need to be answered empirically.

Perhaps, we lack a rigorous understanding of the multi-disciplinary idea of contact tracing that doesn't belong to any specific discipline.
A digital contact tracing system is designed by people belonging to various professions spanning from epidemiologists to computer scientists to user behavior researchers.
Perhaps, there isn't a rigorous framework that combines these disciplines and gives everyone an entry point to explore their ideas and improve contact tracing.
Having such a framework will help us better respond to a future pandemic (please, not again).
In this series of posts, I will attempt to explain the essence of contact tracing, argue that it is primarily a personalization problem, lay down the building blocks of such a framework, and illustrate how existing methods are just different manifestations of this framework.
I will conclude with future directions and the necessity to improve the framework.

As a team of researchers in computer science, machine learning, and epidemiology, we have worked extensively to understand how contact tracing technology can be improved further.
As a result, we proposed a framework called <em>Proactive Contact Tracing</em> that we developed and evaluated with a simulator.
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/project/covi/">While most of the work is in the public domain</a>, this blog presents the framework's high-level ideas to make them more accessible.
Along the way, we will also list improvement areas to help us be better prepared for a future pandemic.

## Acknowledgements


I would like to thank Prof. Yoshua Bengio for <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2020/06/11/science-and-innovation-in-times-of-a-pandemic/" target="_blank">initiating this massive effort to deliver an innovative contact tracing solution</a>.
His involvement and dedication to solve the problem were crucial to navigate the gory complexities involved in this entire project.
As a researcher, it allowed me to use my skills to contribute to social good and taught me to be a better cross-disciplinary collaborator.

This series of articles wouldn't have been possible without a massive collaboration.
It was heartwarming to see how everyone involved in the project was ready to devote their time and skills to develop <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/project/covi/">COVI</a> mobile app that implements the framework discussed in this blog series.
Without their involvement, it would not have been possible to iterate and build this framework.

The whole project evolved organically, with people taking responsibility for their share of work.
It naturally involved massive cross-disciplinary brainstorming sessions.
As a result, our first 2-3 months were spent understanding the objectives, constraints, and challenges of an appropriate Bluetooth communication protocol.
Thus, I would like to thank <a href="#people-covi-paper">all the people involved in COVI White Paper<d-cite key="alsdurf2020covi"></d-cite><a/> for their time to engage in fruitful discussions.
It wouldn't have been possible to sustain the momentum without their involvement.

After the Québec government nixed the idea of using the contact tracing app altogether, subsequent months were involved in prototyping the framework using the simulator.
We hoped to put our ideas in the public domain to be improved further.
These efforts culminated in <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/COVI-AgentSim" target="_blank">COVI-AgentSim<d-cite key="gupta2020covi"></d-cite></a>, a simulator to prototype our proposed framework, and <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/COVI-AgentSim" target="_blank">COVI-ML</a><d-cite key="bengio2020predicting"></d-cite>, a potential deep learning solution to execute the framework.
Thus, I would like to thank <a href="#people-covi-all">the people</a> involved in these efforts for their time, energy, and perseverance.

Lastly, all of the above works wouldn't have been possible without the funding from NSERC, CIHR, CIFAR, FRQNT, Scale AI, and compute resources of MPI-IS cluster, Compute Canada & Calcul Quebec, in particular, the Beluga cluster.

Finally, I'd like to thank <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/profile/" target="_blank">Prof. Yoshua Bengio</a>, Yang Zhang, and <a href="https://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowships/tim-ecott/" target="_blank">Tim Ecott</a> for their helpful feedback in writing this blog.
