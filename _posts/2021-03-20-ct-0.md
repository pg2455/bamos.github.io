As a team of researchers in computer science, machine learning, and epidemiology, we have worked extensively to understand how contact tracing technology can be improved further.
As a result, we proposed a framework called <em>Proactive Contact Tracing</em> that we developed and evaluated with a simulator.
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/project/covi/">While most of the work is in the public domain</a>, this blog presents the framework's high-level ideas to make them more accessible.
Along the way, we will also list improvement areas to help us be better prepared for a future pandemic.
