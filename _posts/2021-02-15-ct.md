## Motivation behind contact tracing
Since March 2020, countries around the world have taken unprecedented measures such as regional lockdowns, strict social distancing measures, etc. to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. While health experts aim to minimize the transmission of the virus while keeping the society functional, the economic experts tend to minimize the economic disruptions. The current pandemic has resulted in several challenges for either parties to fare well in their objectives. Technology has always stepped in to solve such challenging issues. As a result, engineers around the world turned to peer-to-peer bluetooth communication to record (in a privacy preserving manner) encounters between individuals from a certain distance. Several challenges related to the accuracy and privacy of these communications has been the central issue in the development and adoption of these apps.

As a team of computer science and AI researchers, we asked whether we can have a fundamental framework to understand the problem of contact tracing. Even if we can define the problem, we can be creative in devising solutions to the problem. To do exactly this, we turned to virology and learned the stages in which virus grows in a human body, and at what point does it result in more infections. Thus, if technology can be used to predict infectiousness of individuals given their contacts, virus can be tamed. This is what lead to our proposed framework of Proactive Contact Tracing. 

While the trajectory of disease progression varies from virus to virus, our team specifically learned such a pattern in SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 shows a simplified trend.
