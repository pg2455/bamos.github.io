The Covid-19 pandemic has forced policy experts to make challenging trade-offs between public health and economic activity.
As a result, countries have gone through a series of lockdowns, experiencing the perils of a yo-yo economy.
Digital Contact Tracing should have been an obvious technical solution to such a globally prevalent problem, i.e., to control the disease outbreak yet allowing regular daily activity.
But it failed. Why?
Perhaps, we lack a rigorous understanding of contact tracing.
It involves people belonging to various professions spanning epidemiology to computer science and behavioural studies.
Perhaps, there isn't a rigorous framework that combines these disciplines and gives everyone an entry point to explore their ideas and improve contact tracing.
We need a framework to help us better respond to a future pandemic (please, not again).

As a team of researchers in computer science, machine learning, and epidemiology, we worked extensively to understand how contact tracing technology can be improved further.
As a result, we proposed a framework called <em>Proactive Contact Tracing</em> that we developed and evaluated with a simulator.
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/project/covi/">While all of the work is in the public domain</a>, in this series of posts, I will attempt to explain the essence of contact tracing, argue that it is primarily a personalization problem, lay down the building blocks of such a framework, and illustrate how existing methods are just different manifestations of this framework.
I will conclude with future directions and the necessity to improve the framework.

## Acknowledgements


I would like to thank <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/profile/" target="_blank">Prof. Yoshua Bengio</a> for <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2020/06/11/science-and-innovation-in-times-of-a-pandemic/" target="_blank">initiating this massive effort to deliver an innovative contact tracing solution</a>.
His involvement and dedication to solve the problem were crucial to navigate the gory complexities involved in this entire project.
As a researcher, it allowed me to use my skills to contribute to social good and taught me to be a better cross-disciplinary collaborator.

This series of articles wouldn't have been possible without a massive collaboration.
It was heartwarming to see how everyone involved in the project was ready to devote their time and skills to develop the <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/project/covi/">COVI</a> mobile app that implements the framework discussed in this blog series.
Without their involvement, it would not have been possible to iterate and build this framework.

The whole project evolved organically, with people taking responsibility for their share of work.
It naturally involved massive cross-disciplinary brainstorming sessions.
As a result, our first 2-3 months were spent understanding the objectives, constraints, and challenges of an appropriate Bluetooth communication protocol.
Thus, I would like to thank <a href="#people-covi-paper">all the people involved in COVI White Paper<d-cite key="alsdurf2020covi"></d-cite><a/> for their time to engage in fruitful discussions.
It wouldn't have been possible to sustain the momentum without their involvement.

After the Québec government nixed the idea of using the contact tracing app altogether, subsequent months were involved in prototyping the framework using the simulator.
We hoped to put our ideas in the public domain to be improved further.
These efforts culminated in <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/COVI-AgentSim" target="_blank">COVI-AgentSim<d-cite key="gupta2020covi"></d-cite></a>, a simulator to prototype our proposed framework, and <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/COVI-AgentSim" target="_blank">COVI-ML</a><d-cite key="bengio2020predicting"></d-cite>, a potential deep learning solution to execute the framework.
Thus, I would like to thank <a href="#people-covi-all">the people</a> involved in these efforts for their time, energy, perseverance, and creativity.
A special thanks to <a href="http://www.teganmaharaj.com/">Tegan Maharaj</a>, <a href="https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/nrahaman">Nasim Rahaman</a>, <a href="http://www.martin-weiss.me/">Martin Weiss</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahalsdurf/?originalSubdomain=ca">Hannah Alsdurf</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanorminoyan/?originalSubdomain=ca">Nanor Minoyan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soren-harnois-leblanc-rd-msc-phd-c-158050194/?originalSubdomain=ca">Soren Harnois Leblanc</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-merckx-md-msc-3b1a2a147/?originalSubdomain=ca">Joanna Merckx</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-robert-williams/?originalSubdomain=ca">Andrew Williams</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/plstcharles/?originalSubdomain=ca">Pierre-Luc St. Charles</a>, and <a href="https://vict0rs.ch/about/">Victor Schmidt</a> for slogging together and managing various aspects of this work.

Lastly, all of the above works wouldn't have been possible without the funding from NSERC, CIHR, CIFAR, FRQNT, Scale AI, and compute resources of MPI-IS cluster, Compute Canada & Calcul Quebec, in particular, the Beluga cluster.

Finally, I'd like to thank <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/profile/" target="_blank">Prof. Yoshua Bengio</a>, <a href="https://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowships/tim-ecott/" target="_blank">Tim Ecott</a> (RLF Fellow, Exeter College), <a href="https://www.is.mpg.de/~bs" target="_blank">Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf</a>, and  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yang-zhang-616a44190/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank">Yang Zhang</a> for their helpful feedback in writing this blog.
