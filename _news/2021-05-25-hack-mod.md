Here is the hackathon that I designed based on the work of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00372-6" target="_blank">Zoabi et al.</a> to predict COVID infection using symptoms. It was great to see diverse solutions that participants used to tackle the problem. I learned a lot. Thank you!
