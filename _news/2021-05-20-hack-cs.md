I am joining CambridgeSpark team as a part-time faculty. To kick things off, I designed a hackathon for the new batch of L7 learners. This hackathon is based on the work of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00372-6" target="_blank">Zoabi et al.</a> to predict COVID infection using symptoms. It exposes the participants to (a) reading applied machine learning papers, (b) problems encountered while dealing with imbalanced dataset, (c) building a machine learning application end-to-end.
