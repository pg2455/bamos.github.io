## Just ask!
<br>
Career choices are tough.
These are also the choices that decides whether one will end up hating or loving their day-to-day activities.
Having gone through several of these moments myself, I find it extremely useful to talk to others about their career path and their world view.

I have been extremely lucky to have met people at colleges, workplaces, or labs to help in this process.
Thus, I decided to open up 2 hours every week on my schedule to let anyone book some time to ask any questions that can help in their process.
So if you are a parent, undergraduate, post-graduate, or anyone who think that I can be of any help, please feel free to book a time on my calendar.
